# Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

Scheduler is a scheduling algorithms simulator written in C++ using the Qt widget toolkit. This tool provides an interactive platform that helps you visualize and understand various scheduling algorithms by simulating their processes in a user-friendly graphical interface. It serves as an educational resource, making it easier for students and professionals alike to understand the intricacies of process scheduling in operating systems.

## Available Scheduling Algorithms

The user can choose among several scheduling algorithms:
